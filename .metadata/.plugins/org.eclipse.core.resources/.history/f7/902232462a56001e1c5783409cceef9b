//Inheritance is a process in which acquiring properties from one type to another type
//Inheriting a class from multiple base class is known as multiple inheritance - Java doesn't support multiple inheritance
//Advantages: Less Dev time, Less Memory consumption, Improved Performance, Redundancy(Data De-duplication)
