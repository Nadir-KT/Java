/*
Java Swing is a part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC) that is used to create window-based applications. 
It is built on the top of AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit) API (API: Group of classes & Interfaces)and entirely written in java.


Unlike AWT, Java Swing provides platform-independent and lightweight components.

The javax.swing package provides classes for java swing API such as JButton, JTextField, JTextArea, 
JRadioButton, JCheckbox, JMenu, JColorChooser etc.

Swing (javax.swing.*): platform-independent, lightweight components, More components  , Follows MV (Model-View-Controller)
AWT   (java.awt.*)   : platform-dependent  , Heavyweight components, Lesser Components, Doesn't Follow MVC
